// pageH-tall pages, returning one-or-more pages. pageH <= 0 means no pagination:
// it returns exactly what Layout returns (a single tall page sized to the content
// height) — the byte-identical path. Otherwise it builds the same fragment tree as
// Layout (via the shared layoutTree), then splits the document's top-level in-flow
// block fragments into pageH-tall pages, breaking between block boundaries and at
// forced page breaks (break-before / break-after: page|always and the legacy
// page-break-* aliases).
//
// It never panics on malformed input: a recover at the page boundary returns a
// single empty pageH-tall page. It degrades gracefully — a single block taller than
// a page overflows its page rather than splitting (logged once per over-tall block).
// position:relative blocks paginate normally (a top-level one is routed to its bucket's
// page; one nested under a static wrapper rides its nearest top-level ancestor's page),
// and a relative block's abs descendants and its own border/clip follow it (shiftFragment
// moves them). Only absolute/fixed boxes whose containing block is the page (not a
// paginated relative ancestor) are undistributed and ride the first page — a documented
// deferral. The html/body wrapper's border/background is fragmented per page.
