	// Unlike WordBreak this is NOT carried opaquely to the breaker: it is folded into

	// the browsers, deliberately, because alignment is the observable consequence and
	// matching Firefox/Chrome/Safari is the browser-faithful choice.
	//
	// This is exactly where the CSS path DIVERGES from pkg/svg, which implements the
	// same property against SVG 1.1's literal wording and adds NO trailing gap (see
	// pkg/svg/draw's applyTextSpacing, whose rule the resvg corpus pins with

	// default) leaves advances untouched.
	//
	// Note the interaction with justification: a justified line distributes its slack at
	// inter-word gaps (inline.Place's ExtraPerSpace), and word-spacing has ALREADY been
	// folded into each space's advance before that slack is computed. The two therefore

//     MATHEMATICAL SPACE, and U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE. These appear in ordinary
//     well-formed text — U+202F alone occurs in this repo's own showcase — and the
//     bundled substitutes map only a few of them.
//   - Zl/Zp LINE and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (U+2028, U+2029).
//   - Cf FORMAT: the zero-width set (U+200B..U+200F), the bidi controls
//     (U+202A..U+202E, U+2060..U+2064, U+2066..U+2069), U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN, the
//     variation selectors (U+FE00..U+FE0F), and U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE.
//   - Cc CONTROL (U+0000..U+001F, U+007F..U+009F), which has no printable form.

// intercepts them earlier in Shape, since they must keep a zero-width slot for the
// reorder rather than a space-sized advance.
//
// The list is only consulted for a rune NOTHING maps, so a font's own decision wins
// where it has one. U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN is the instructive case: the bundled faces
