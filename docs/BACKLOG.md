# Backlog — outstanding fidelity work

The single list of what is NOT done. Shipped work lives in [../FEATURES.md](../FEATURES.md);
deliberate exclusions live in [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md). Prose on subsystems in progress is in
[CSS-LAYOUT.md](CSS-LAYOUT.md), [PDF.md](PDF.md), [DOCX.md](DOCX.md), and [SVG.md](SVG.md).

**Goal:** fix every fidelity issue in the engine — HTML/CSS, PDF, and DOCX-render — until the
only remaining gaps are the explicitly out-of-scope ones. Each fix lands with a fixture/test in
the same PR, mutation-verified, corpus byte-identical except intended golden changes (eyeballed).

Status legend: ☐ open · ◐ in progress.

## Where it stands

**29 open · 2 in progress**, audited against the code on 2026-08-30 (see below). The engine is
feature-complete across its stated scope; what remains is a long tail of approximations, each
degrading gracefully — and, where a degradation changes rendering, saying so in the log.

This file replaced three overlapping documents (`FIDELITY-BACKLOG.md`, `GAPS-REMEDIATION.md`,
`GAPS-REMEDIATION-2.md`) that had accumulated ~1,100 lines of prose about finished work, against
CLAUDE.md's rule that these files hold only what is outstanding. The write-ups for completed work
are in git history — `git log --diff-filter=D --name-only` finds the removing commit, and
`git show <rev>^:docs/GAPS-REMEDIATION.md` reads any of them at full length. The design rationale
for each shipped item is also in its own PR and commit messages.

**Every entry below was checked against the code when this file was written**, because the
document it replaced warned that its own checkboxes were untrustworthy and named five stale
entries. That warning was justified and was still under-counting: this audit found three more.
Two were entries claiming work was outstanding when it had shipped (`transform`, `writing-mode`);
one, E1, ran the other way and claimed more had shipped than actually had. **Re-verify before
trusting any entry that has aged** — grep for the claimed symptom first.

## HTML/CSS — positioning

- ☐ **C1. Precise static-position solve** for an all-`auto`-offset abs box (today approximates to the
  containing block's top-left). *Deferred (Medium).* Needs each abs box's hypothetical in-flow position
  captured at collection time (`layoutBlockChildren`) and threaded onto `deferredAbs` — it touches the
  core positioning path. The approximation is documented and logged (`block.go`, "static-position
  approximation"). Low frequency: all-auto abs is uncommon.
- ☐ **C4. Percentage `top`/`bottom` against an auto-height containing block.** *Deferred (Medium).*
  Vertical percentages resolve against the CB's computed height; an auto-height CB's height does not
  account for the out-of-flow box. Documented edge case, low value.
- ☐ **C5. `bottom`-only auto-height abs box.** *Deferred (Medium).* Needs a shrink-to-fit HEIGHT (the C2
  machinery, but vertical); the engine measures content WIDTH only — the same single-axis limitation D3,
  flex, grid, and table vertical-content sizing all share. Documented and logged (`block.go`,
  "positioned against a provisional height").
- ☐ **C6. `position: relative` on a text-only inline box.** *Deferred (Medium–large).* Structural: a
  `BoxInline` generates no fragment (its glyphs flatten into the parent's lines), so there is nothing to
  carry a `RelOffset`. Needs inline-box fragments or a per-run offset on `LineFragment`. Block-level
  relative is exact; atomic inline-block/replaced relative is a separate known no-op. **Not silent:** a
  non-zero offset warns once per layout (`warnRelativeInline`, `positioning.go`). A zero/absent offset
  stays quiet — that is the establish-a-containing-block idiom, and it works.

## HTML/CSS — replaced content

- ☐ **D3. Percentage `height` basis on replaced elements.** *Deferred (structural).* Needs a definite
  containing-block HEIGHT threaded through the layout chain; the engine is fundamentally single-axis, so
  a percentage height resolves against a 0 basis and is treated as auto. Logged (`replaced.go`, "no
  basis; treating as auto"). Broad plumbing change, low frequency.

## HTML/CSS — inline and flow

- ☐ **E1. Full `vertical-align` keyword set.** *Medium–large.* **Only `super` and `sub` are implemented**
  (`baselineShiftPt`, `inline.go`, as an em-scaled baseline shift); `top`/`middle`/`bottom`/`text-top`/
  `text-bottom`/percentage/length all fall through to a 0 shift. Table cells are a separate mechanism
  (`table.go` reads `VerticalAlign` for cell alignment) and are unaffected.
  *Audit note: the entry this replaced listed the whole keyword set as landed. It had not.*
- ☐ **E3. Margin-collapse edge cases** — empty-block collapse-through, clearance, `min-height`
  interaction. *Medium.* Collapse-through is **no longer silent**: an empty block's margins do not
  collapse through it (CSS 2.1 §8.3.1), so an empty `<div style="margin:40px 0">` between two paragraphs
  opens an 80pt gap where a browser gives 40pt — measured, warned once per layout
  (`warnCollapseThrough`), and pinned by a test that fails if the gap is ever fixed. Clearance and the
  `min-height` interaction are still silent; both need collapse state carried across the split point,
  which is the same plumbing this entry is about.

## HTML/CSS — tables

- ☐ **F8. A rowspan cell whose *spanned-into* row grows from baseline does not re-grow.** *Deferred
  (localized).* Needs the cross-row baseline re-solve the table design deliberately avoids. Documented in
  `table.go`. Low value, high complexity. (Same issue as I6.)

## HTML/CSS — web fonts

- ☐ **G1. Synthetic bold/oblique** for an `@font-face` family supplying one variant. *Medium.* Note the
  bundled substitutes ship regular-only — resolving K6 also unblocks this caveat.
- ☐ **G2. `unicode-range` subsetting.** *Medium.* The whole face is used for every rune. The descriptor
  is **not** parsed into `FontFace` — it is recognized and reported, not honoured. It reaches
  `Stylesheet.Unsupported` and is logged once by a caller holding a logger, so the wrong-face case is at
  least explicable. *Audit note: an earlier entry called this "captured-but-ignored", which overstated
  it — nothing captured it.*
- ☐ **G3. `font-display`.** *Small.* No async loading exists in synchronous layout, so this is likely a
  documented no-op kept permanently. Reported alongside G2 so an author can tell which of the two
  descriptors was honoured — neither is, and the log now says so.
- ☐ **G4. Variable-font axes** (`font-variation-settings` → default instance). *Large.* No `fvar`
  handling exists.
- ☐ **G5. `local()` beyond `DiskFontProvider`** — no OS font-store enumeration. *Medium*
  (platform-specific).
- ☐ **G6. Content-addressed fetch cache.** *Small (perf).* `FaceCache` is keyed `(family, style)`
  (`faceKey`, `cache.go`), so one file is fetched per style.

## HTML/CSS — grid

- ☐ **I1. Named-LINE placement** (`grid-column: start/end` referencing `[name]`s). *Deferred (Medium).*
  Needs new machinery: `TrackList` has no named-line storage and placement never resolves a line name.
  *Audit note: a `LineName` placement kind DOES exist in `grid_value.go` — it carries grid-AREA names,
  which resolve at placement. The gap is the track-list side, not the parser as the old entry implied.*
- ☐ **I2. Flow-axis-locked auto-placement** (definite flow-axis line + auto cross axis honours the span,
  ignores the start line). *Deferred (Small)* — a documented, non-overlapping simplification:
  `grid_place.go` scans the locked line from 0 rather than continuing the sparse cursor.
  **Deliberately NOT logged.** Unlike the other degradations here, this always produces a valid,
  non-overlapping placement and differs from a browser only in WHICH free slot a sparse locked item
  lands in. There is no runtime test for "this diverged" short of running the browser algorithm — which
  is the fix — so a log would fire on every sparse locked item and tell the author nothing actionable.
  `dense` resets to the origin anyway, which is spec-correct, so only sparse diverges at all.
- ☐ **I6. Rowspan cell whose spanned-into row grows from baseline** — same as F8.
- ☐ **I7. `subgrid`** (degrades to `none`; the caller logs). *Large.*
- ☐ **I8. `repeat(auto-fill/auto-fit)` empty-track collapse is approximate.** *Medium.*

## PDF — feature gaps

- ☐ **K1. Scan filters** — ◐ in progress. JBIG2 is **done** (vendored pure-Go Apache-2.0 decoder).
  **JPX/JPEG2000 remains blocked:** no viable pure-Go decoder exists, and writing one is out of
  proportion to the demand. See [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) for why a cgo decoder is not an option.
- ☐ **K2. Tiling patterns (PatternType 1)** — skipped and logged today. *Medium.* The log is real and was
  re-verified at `pkg/internal/raster/page.go` ("unsupported /PatternType %d (only shading patterns)")
  plus `pkg/internal/content/shading.go`. Cited because an audit once doubted this entry after reading the
  interface doc comment in `interp.go`, which is not the implementation.
- ☐ **K3. Higher-fidelity Coons/tensor patches (Types 6/7)** — bicubic boundary vs. the current
  bilinear-corner approximation. *Medium.*
- ☐ **K4. Luminosity soft masks (`/SMask` in ExtGState) + transparency groups.** *Large.* The interpreter
  tracks the `/SMask` state (including explicit `/None`) and reports what it cannot resolve; what is
  missing is the rendering.
- ☐ **K5. Encryption: non-empty user/owner passwords, per-stream `/Crypt` overrides, `/Perms`
  validation.** *Medium.* Only empty-password documents authenticate today (`pkg/pdf/crypt.go`).
- ☐ **K6. Base-14 weights and symbol fonts** — bold/italic/oblique map to regular (this affects DOCX
  too), and Symbol/ZapfDingbats have no substitute, so those runs are skipped. Needs bundled weighted
  faces, symbol look-alikes, and AFM widths. *Medium–large.*

## PDF — performance

- ☐ **L1. Per-glyph paint allocations** (`paint.go transformPath` + `device.go rasterizeMask`, ~3 per
  glyph). Only worth a transformed-glyph cache if profiling shows paint dominating. *Small–medium.*
- ☐ **L2. `over()` straight-vs-premultiplied alpha** (`device.go`) — latent fragility if a transparent
  page background is ever introduced. Not a live bug. *Small (document or harden).*

## DOCX

- ☐ **M5. Embedded fonts** — de-obfuscate `word/fonts/*`, which also fixes bold/italic. *Medium.* DOCX
  additionally resolves bundled-only today: the `OSFontProvider` seam exists and the HTML and PDF
  backends install it, but `docxDocument` (`reflow_backend.go`) does not.

## Pagination — structural

- ☐ **N1. Mid-box splitting** — ◐ in progress. Most of it landed: pagination splits a nested spine, a
  table row through its cells, and a mid-block forced break, and `<thead>` repeats on continuation pages.
  What remains:
  - ☐ **N1d. Mid-flex-item / mid-grid-item splitting.** *Very large; recommend permanent deferral.*
    Requires the fragmentainer to reach into flex line sizing and grid track sizing, since
    `flex-grow`/`stretch`/`fr` size items collectively and would have to be re-solved per fragmentainer.
    Already an owner-signed deferral, and the case with the least real-world demand.
- ☐ **N4. Per-page float distribution.** *Medium.*
